# Mada Rent

> A centralized rental listings platform for Madagascar

## What is Mada Rent?

Mada Rent is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding and listing rental properties across Madagascar. By aggregating scattered Facebook Group posts and offering direct property-owner listings, it provides a single, reliable source for renters and landlords alike.

## What does it do?

- **Centralized Listings**  
  Pulls recent rental posts from multiple Facebook groups into one unified feed.

- **Owner Direct Posts**  
  Allows ‚Äúpropri√©taires‚Äù (landlords) to create and manage their own listings, with clear availability statuses (available, booked, rented).

- **Advanced Filters**  
  Search by city, price range, property type, and more to quickly find the right home.

- **Verified Quality**  
  All listings‚Äîwhether aggregated or owner-submitted‚Äîare manually reviewed to ensure accuracy and reduce scams.

- **Secure Contact Gateway**  
  Renters pay a small fee (5 000 Ar) to contact landlords directly; landlords pay (10 000 Ar) per confirmed visit, ensuring serious inquiries only.
